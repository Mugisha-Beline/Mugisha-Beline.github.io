      <h2 id="about me">little things about me</h2>
      <p>I am by name of Mugisha Ahujabe Beline, and am from Musanze and am highschool graduate happy to study about coding in Moringa school.</p>
      <p>i grown up in a chip family where i wasn't able to get an access to a techinological devices, but i always wanted to know more about computers, how they work something like that. and finally after finishing o'level i chose to study computer science so that i may start my journey of coding. it wasn't as i tought becouse in secondary we only did theory with few practices but during those theories made me feel like i want it so bad.</p>
      <p>The time i heard about we code at Moringa school i decided to apply so that i will becouse it was my best opportunity to continue my journey of being a prograner as i wished.</p>
